# TODO
- split into multiple files/classes
- make sure correct player gets point
- ball should go into AI or player hand depending on who won last point
	SCENARIOS
	- ball hits playerX, playerX loses
	- ball offscreen, last touched playerX, playerX loses
	- ball offscreen, last touched table or none, if ball on playerX side of screen, playerX loses
- coworker movement and serve functionality
- hold A to charge swing
- limit player vertical movement
- B button to return a smash
- POWERSMASH that requires a pause and using the crank to do a smash


# IDEAS
- the table and players kinda look like a face, i wonder if there is a way to use that
