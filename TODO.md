# TODO
- smash animation:
	- player smash meter is full so they can smash
	- hold B and release to smash
	- ball goes straight towards other player at speed depending on windup
	- opponent can return with b or get out of the way
	- if opponent gets hit they fly off screen
- coworker serve functionality
- ball should go into AI or player hand depending on who won last point
- B button to return a smash
- POWERSMASH that requires a pause and cinematic animation and requires using the crank to do a smash
- story for tournament and multiple rounds before gameover
- office movement:
	- server light flash
	- boss getting up crossing arms from time to time
	- 2 frame animation for each desk employee+state
	- player/coworker stance bounce
- dialog system

# IDEAS
- the table and players kinda look like a face, i wonder if there is a way to use that
