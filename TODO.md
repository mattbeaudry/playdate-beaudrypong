# TODO
- split into multiple files/classes
- Smash type swing that requires a pause and using the crank to do a smash
- make sure correct player gets point
- ball should go into AI or player hand depending on who won last show
- coworker movement and serve functionality
- hold A to charge swing
- limit player vertical movement
- B button to return a smash

# IDEAS
- the table and players kinda look like a face, i wonder if there is a way to use that
